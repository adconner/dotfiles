Installation:

Let path/to/dotfiles be some path that resolves to the dotfiles directory from the home directory ~. This will be the path which the links use to refer to the dotfiles (I use a relative path from the home directory). For convenience,
DOTFILES=path/to/dotfiles

Then manually link each file to homefolder:
cd
ln -svTi $DOTFILES/<file> .<file>
...
